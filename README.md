# Mock Image Pipeline Using Apache Kafka

## <u>Description</u>

This is a mock image processing pipeline using Apache Kafka.  

It uses python Kafka clients to do the image processing work.  

It receives images, stores them in a database, analyzes them to detect an "image event" of interest, and notifies interested parties when the "image" event of interest occurs.  

The mock aspects are:  

- The images are not received from an external source. They are generated by the image receiving client.
- The image database is image files in a directory

## <u>Commands</u>

### Build Apache Kafka image and create a container that automatically runs Apache Kafka
If you've already issued the below docker (pipeline) image/container creation commands on your system, then you may first need to clean up your Docker environment:  

$ docker stop pipeline_container
$ docker rm pipeline_container  
$ docker rmi pipeline_image



$ docker build -t pipeline_image .  
$ docker run -v \<path where this application's code files are stored>:/pipeline --name pipeline_container -u="root" -p 9092:9092 pipeline_image

### <u>Open a command-line window, enter the container and run the image analysis Kafka client</u>
Open a command-line window and enter the following commands:  

$ docker exec -it pipeline_container /bin/bash  
     (you will automatically be put in the  /pipeline directory of the container)  
$ python image_analysis.py

### <u>Open a command-line window, enter the container and run the image receiving Kafka client</u>
Open a command-line window and enter the following commands:  

$ docker exec -it pipeline_container /bin/bash  
     (you will automatically be put in the /pipeline directory of the container)  
$ python image_receiving.py



### If everything runs successfully (according to the text output), you can also look in the image_database directory to see the "stored" images.
