To Do for mock pipeline
-----------------------

- clean up CONSTANTS package/module setup
- investigate ramifications of using -u="root" in docker run command
- automate the process of building/running the Apache Kafka image/container and opening the command line
  windows for the python Kafka clients and running them
- do tkinter stuff inside of container?
- add logic to image event view webpage application that checks that
  a proper entered image event alert positive integer number was actually used during
  the preceding image pipeline run (i.e., not zero or too high)
- move image pipeline to the Amazon Cloud
